This fork of the Symbiota code is being developed in parallel to the core code maintained by the Biodiversity Knowledge Integration Center (BioKIC, https://github.com/BioKIC) team.
If you are interested in a Symbiota implimentation, please download or fork the code directly from the BioKIC/Symbiota repository (https://github.com/BioKIC/Symbiota). 
American Bamboos makes no commitment to maintaining alignment between this repository and the upstream BioKIC/Symbiota codebase.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Symbiota was generously funded by the National Science Foundation (DBI-0743827) from 15 July 2008 to 30 June 2011. The Global Institute of Sustainability (GIOS) at Arizona State University also supported the Symbiota initiative since the very beginning. Arizona State University Vascular Plant and Lichen Herbarium, Sky Island Alliance, and the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum have all been involved in the development of that product.

The American Bamboos Symbiota instance builds off this great work to bring a unique resource for the remarkable grass subfamily Bambusoideae.
